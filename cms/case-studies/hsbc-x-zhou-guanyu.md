The project's unique challenge arose from IMG's predominantly English-speaking production team. First Tone solved this by supplying bilingual crew members who were proficient in both languages and experienced in film production. This ensured not only smooth communication between all parties but also allowed for a focus on Zhou Guanyu, who was central to the campaign's success. The outcome? A project that met its linguistic and artistic objectives to the satisfaction of everyone involved."
